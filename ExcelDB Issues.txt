ExcelDB Issues
1) Clean up presentation
    i.) Get rid of view controller essentially, and jump right to the modification screen.
2) Check what is causing mark up option to not work.
3) Make output up to government standards.
4) Map 3 digit code to company name.
    i.) Whenever a new code is discovered in the first three digits of the filename, add it to the manufacturer list and let the user add the name later.
5) Drop incomplete entries (if an entry has empty strings or if there isn't a pattern match for any one of the three fields, drop it).
